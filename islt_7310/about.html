    <h3>Some things about me</h3>
    <p>Hi my name is Ben, I’m a junior studying IT and Computer Science. I picked both because I’ve always had a love for IT but in the last few years became really interested in software development. Algorithm design courses has been some of my favorite so far, while it may not be the most practical for <em>real</em> world <em>development</em>, it is still a fun challenge almost like a <b>puzzle</b>. I already have some experience with web development so this will be a good refresher for me. <br>I tend to have a good sense of design so I believe that will be put to the test in this course. My goal for the course is to refine my understanding of HTML and CSS by hopefully picking up some new ideas that I may have glossed over in the past. I occasionally work with HTML and CSS at work as well, so this course will be good for that as well.</p>
    <p>I'm currently a Junior at the university of missouri columbia. I'm majoring in IT with a minor in computer science. So far in my education I have completed the core computer science courses. I have completed multiple mython courses. I have also completed one web design course. As far as my interests go, I would like to narrow in more on courses that go more in depth on web design as well as more about how a design can influence a person that visits your site.</p>
