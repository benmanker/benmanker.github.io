    <title>Welcome to Ben's Website</title>
</head>
<body>Hi my name is Ben, I’m a junior studying IT and Computer Science. I picked both because I’ve always had a love for IT but in the last few years became really interested in software development. Algorithm design courses has been some of my favorite so far, while it may not be the most practical for real world development, it is still a fun challenge almost like a puzzle. I already have some experience with web development so this will be a good refresher for me. I tend to have a good sense of design so I believe that will be put to the test in this course. My goal for the course is to refine my understanding of HTML and CSS by hopefully picking up some new ideas that I may have glossed over in the past. I occasionally work with HTML and CSS at work as well, so this course will be good for that too.</body>

Home Page.  Welcome statement (1- 2 sentences). Short paragraph on the purpose, goals, and objectives of the website (150 words).

Step 1: Start with your index.html file in Visual Studio Code (we will save over the file you uploaded to GitHub in your last Activity).

Step 2: Use the remaining content for your Home Page that was submitted in Week 1, with any edits and revisions made. Edit any content you have already submitted as part of the Activities.

Step 3: You must include and use the following:

Use all HTML5 semantic elements (header, main, nav, footer) (we will revisit this later to be more specific, this is simply to group your content for coding later!), for now, you will have content inside the <header>, <main> and the <footer> elements and nothing inside the <nav> element.
Add  a comment header at the top.
Add the Content for your Home Page  (see your Week 1 Project submission), plus any additional text needed
Double-check you have the proper page title and metadata in the <head> - hint you should only have one metadata at this point!
Use <h1> and one other heading (choose from <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>) - hint, H1 should be the only content that goes between the <header> semantic element!
Use <p> element - must be used for all text not included in another element. - hint, this should go between the <main> semantic element tags!
Create a footer (hint this is a semantic element!) that contains your name and MU email, and a short copyright notice.
Copy all your code inside your Body tags of your existing index.html file if you have not directly typed it.
Save your index.html file (do not use Save As to create a different file, you should save over your existing file!)
