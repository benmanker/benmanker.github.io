      <h3>A little bit about my education journey:</h3>
      <div class="paragraphs">
        <br />
        <p>
          Currently in my career I'm working at a company called ThermAvant. I
          do IT support and a variety of other things. It has been a huge
          learning experience. I love that I'm able to get real world experience
          in my degree field while still in school!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="indent">
          My experience so far with the Mizzou IT and CS departments has been
          great. I love having a mix of IT and CS classes. I tend to notice that
          IT can be a bit more of practical application while computer science
          is more theorey. I really enjoy both aspects and think both are
          extermely valuable skills to have.
        </p>
        <br />

          There are 2 areas in which I have seen the most dramatic imporvements
          over the course of my college journey. The first one is C programming
          and algorithm design. Learning the C programming language from the
          ground up is a challenging yet rewarding task. It has taught me so
          much about programming and is my favorite language so far. Then being
          able to apply that knowledge to designing and implementing algorithms
          is very interesting to me.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="indent">
          The second area that I have seen the most imporvement in is web
          development. Before learning web development, I didn't think much of
          it. Now I look at it as so much more than that. It can be extermely
          complex when you begin to learn more about implementing databases,
          api's, different javascript frameworks, user authentication, and so
          much more. For me, web development will be a field in which I'm always
          growing and wanting to learn more.
